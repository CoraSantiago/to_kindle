# to_kindle

This is my first project here, so please be understanding. I welcome any suggestions for improvement.

The purpose of this code is for when you need to read something in a book-like text format and prefer to do so from the comfort of your old Kindle that practically has no web browsing capabilities. It scrapes all the web pages using a loop, acting as a chapter counter, generates the epub (for better visual comfort), and sends it directly to your Kindle email.

I ended up not adding text formatting structure because it varies greatly depending on the webpage you want to scrape
